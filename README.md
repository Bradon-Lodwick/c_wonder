## DESCRIPTION
Since 2014, the Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) began an ambitious
initiative to deliver Kindergarten to Grade 12 engineering outreach programs to youth in Durham Region. After a concerted, multi-faceted
effort over the past three years, the program has grown to reach over 4,000 students annually. The goal is to inspire youth to ask
questions and empower them to develop solutions to everyday problems using the engineering design process.
The initiative of this group is to develop and implement a resource management database. The purpose of this database is to keep track of
all supplies and resources available to the instructors. The instructors must have control over what they are able to bring to each
program as well as be able to replace items that have become defective or have been broken. Furthermore, the administrator must be able to
change the contents of the inventory and of the contents of the predetermined kits. Finally, the Database must be able to easily output a
readable table that defines the collection of metrics.

## SETUP
1. Download xampp, wamp, lamp, or another similar server package, or have a web server running that supports mysql and php
2. Copy the contents of the htdocs folder to the root directory of your website
3. Connect to your database where you would like to create the c_wonder database, and run the create_database.sql script
4. Connect to the root of your website, and you should be redirected load2.php. If you are able to select tables and views, then your 
install is completed!
